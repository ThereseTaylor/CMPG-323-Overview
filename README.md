#Project Structure:

#Branching Strategy: 
This repository will make use of main, develop and feature branches. The main branch will be used to store the official release history (that will be the history of the finished version of each project). The develop branch will contain the complete development history of each project and serve as an integration branch for features. Each new feature will reside in its own branch, with develop as their parent branch. When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop.
