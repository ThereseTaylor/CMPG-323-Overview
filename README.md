**<ins>Outline of Repositories:</ins>** <br />
This Overview Repository will be used to group all the other projects together as well as link the Github project created for Project 1. Each project will have a seperate folder within this repository, which will be used as follows: <br />
* CMPG 323 Project 2 - 25830473: In this project I will create a CRUD Restful API. For more details: [Project 2 ReadMe](https://github.com/ThereseTaylor/CMPG-323-Overview-25830473/tree/main/CMPG%20323%20Project%202%20-%2025830473/README.md);
* CMPG 323 Project 3 - 25830473: In this project I will take a existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application and enhance it: [Project 3 ReadMe](https://github.com/ThereseTaylor/CMPG-323-Overview-25830473/tree/main/CMPG%20323%20Project%203%20-%2025830473/README.md);
* CMPG 323 Project 4 - 25830473: In this project I will use UI Automation to test the results generated by Project 3;
* CMPG 323 Project 5 - 25830473: In this project I will create a report using PowerBI.

**<ins>Branching Strategy:<ins>** <br />
This repository will make use of main, develop and feature branches. The main branch will be used to store the official release history (that will be the history of the finished version of each project). The develop branch will contain the complete development history of each project and serve as an integration branch for features. Each new feature will reside in its own branch, with develop as their parent branch. When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop.

**<ins>Use of .gitignore File:<ins>** <br />
The purpose of gitignore file in the repository is to ensure that certain files not tracked by Git remain untracked. In Visual Studio it will be used to ignore files like temporary files, credentials, build results and files generated by popular Visual Studio add-ons. This repository includes the files that can be ignored: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/VisualStudio.gitignore

**<ins>Storage of Credentials:<ins>** <br />
Github Secrets can be used to store sensitive information. These secrets will be configured at repository level. Secrets are encrypted before reaching GitHub, it occurs when the secret is submitted using the UI or through the REST API. It helps minimize the risks related to accidental logging (for example, exception logs and request logs, among others) within GitHub's infrastructure. Once the secret is uploaded, GitHub is then able to decrypt it so that it can be injected into the workflow runtime.
